# Forest-Fires-Prediction
EE 559 Project

## Abstract
A forest fire is an unplanned and uncontrollable event and can be caused due to natural events such as ignition by the sunâ€™s heat or a lightning strike or due to human activities like unattended campfires and discarded cigarettes. It causes threat to human life and large amounts of economic and ecological damage. Climate change has increased the number of forest fires in the last decade,making them more common and severe. 

In this paper, we have implemented seven different models namely Trivial, Nearest Means, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Networks to be able to find the best model that is correctly able to predict based on inputs about whether there would be a fire or not. We make use of features like the date, Temperature, Rolling Temperature, Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code, Initial Spread Index, and Build Up Index. The best performing model is the Decision Tree model which has an accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.9.
